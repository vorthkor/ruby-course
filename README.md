# Let's Use If/Else Statements to Find Out Ruby's Favorite Color
This repository will help you learn the fundamentals of If/Else statements in Ruby.

When completed, you'll have a program that asks for your favorite color, and replies with a specific response depending on your input.


## Here are some suggestions for things you can do to expand on what we learned here today:

- [ ] Look into Elsif Statements to create a third branching pathway. For example, if the user inputs "red," make the program respond with something like "It's not as good as blue, but red isn't too bad."

- [ ] Look into the downcase method and implement it into the project so that no matter what case the user inputs "blue" in, they'll see the expected response.

- [ ] Look into Logical Operators to make the program respond with their favorite color being either "blue" or "green."
